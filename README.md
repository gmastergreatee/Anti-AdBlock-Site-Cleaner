# Anti-AdBlock-Site-Cleaner

Well, most of the sites nowadays have ads. And to remove them, Ad-Block Plus works really great.

But in some sites, it is detected & then they force the user to disable ad-block to view their site.

To make sure I don't see those annoying ads ever again, I made some userscripts for myself.

To use them install [TamperMonkey](https://tampermonkey.net/) & then use the given scripts __(in scripts folder)__ to remove all the ads from respective anti-adblock site.

To install a script(*.user.js), open the script page, then click on the __"Raw"__ button.

__NOTE :__ Each script is limited to its respective website but can be modified to support any other site.

Some of the other helpful extensions that I use are :
- adf.ly KILLER                          - Helps in bypassing url-shorteners(very helpful for downloading video links from `todaytvseries2.com`)
- Pop up blocker for Chrome              - Blocks all popups & also asks the user if they want them to be shown
- Adblock Plus                           - Want some explanation? Read the name again!
- OFFMP4                                 - Extension by 9xbuddy to get direct download links from a multitude of video/audio websites
- DataSaver                              - By google, supposedly saves data/bandwidth.(many sites don't like this)

I use Chrome, so some of the above extensions may only be available for it.

And yea, I use EagleGet coz it has one of the most stable download system I ever used(GUI based). Also it has good integration with chrome
and grabs all the video/audio links for me.

BTW, the best extension I used that could grab almost all of the streams was that of xTream Download Manager, but I kinda hated its GUI program(more like made for touch-screens - huge buttons & stuff)
